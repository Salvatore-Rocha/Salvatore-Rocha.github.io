  <p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify;">
    I'm a professional with over 10 years of experience building and launching market-ready solutions. I combine technical and strategic thinking to help organizations innovate and make better decisions through data.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    I completed my Master's (2020) at the University of Hildesheim, supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-K5vyxQAAAAJ">Dr. Julia Rieck</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l3taTdYAAAAJ">Dr. Lars Schmidt-Thieme</a>. My research focused on algorithmic trading, resource allocation, and optimization.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Before that, I earned a Diploma in Innovation and Entrepreneurship from Anahuac University (2017), and a BSc in Chemical Engineering (2013) with a focus on Materials Science from the Autonomous University of Queretaro, M√©xico.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    My professional journey began as a Chemical Engineer at Colgate-Palmolive's Global Technology Center in Mexico, where I led the implementation of the Home Care European Portfolio‚Äîfrom lab to manufacturing. I then joined the University of Hildesheim as a Research Assistant in the Economics and Operations Department and supported teaching in Mathematical Optimization Techniques and Advanced Marketing.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Back in Mexico, I worked as a Project Manager at Rotoplas Group, developing products and services for the Water Treatment and Purification Division across Mexico and Central America. I was later promoted to Scrum Master in the Transformation Office, overseeing the New Business Division with services in the U.S. and Mexico.
