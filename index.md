# Jose Gallego-Posada

## About

I completed my PhD at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) and the [University of Montr√©al](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/) supervised by [Simon Lacoste-Julien](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~slacoste/). My doctoral research was partially supported by an [IVADO PhD Excellence Scholarship](https://ivado.ca/en/scholarships-and-grants/phd-excellence-scholarships/). Before joining Mila, I completed my MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/) in 2018, supervised by [Patrick Forr√©](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fWbf74cAAAAJ&hl=en). I hold a BSc in Mathematical Engineering from [Universidad EAFIT](http://www.eafit.edu.co/) in Medellin.

I study how to solve constrained optimization problems involving neural networks. I have also worked in adaptive optimization, equivariant deep learning, geometric information theory, federated learning, and applications of algebraic geometry to machine learning.

I am one of the lead developers of [Cooper](https://github.com/cooper-org/cooper), an open-source library for non-convex constrained optimization in PyTorch.

My CV is available [here.](resources/cv_joseGallegoPosada.pdf)

My name is pronounced [Xose Ga ùego Posada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Spanish).

My [Dijkstra](https://www.csauthors.net/distance/jose-gallego-posada/edsger-w-dijkstra) and [Erd≈ës](https://www.csauthors.net/distance/jose-gallego-posada/paul-erdos) numbers are 4.
